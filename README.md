2. Once installed, put your plugin to the plugins folder.
Restart, and should work.
If the plugin doesn't install or has issues enabling, please check via console with the errors. If nothing comes up, look in your server.log page. Surely there should be something there. :P

Thank you, and make sure to stay tuned if you have found a Survivalgames plugin, but most parts are extremly buggy or do not function very well, then you can use this plugin as an alternative. Some bugs as always may occur, but soon, this plugin may be bug-free, and all ready for use. This is why reporting the bug early let's us fix it ASAP.

## Can we use normal builds for Betas instead of the official BETA release?
Yes, actually you can.
Just go to this link here: https://poggit.pmmp.io/ci/iZeaoGamer/SurvivalGames/SurvivalGames
It should give a more up-to date view regarding builds. All builds will end up there, for BETA Builds. We usually release BETA builds on the poggit page, before releasing them publickly on the github releases tab. If however the Builds doesn't seem to be updating, then you can download the zip file of this. Here's the download file for the ZIp file: https://github.com/iZeaoGamer/SurvivalGames/archive/master.zip
